## NOTE
Most of the contents in this repository will be from either online resources or an older version of "Objects first with Java" by Barnes KÃ¶lling (I bought this as a second-hand, latest version is available [here](https://www.bluej.org/objects-first/)). Please do not rely on the code in this repository, and please be sure to refer to the original code's license and permissions if you try to use any of the code in this repository, as I cannot ensure their availability other than self-taught learning for myself.
